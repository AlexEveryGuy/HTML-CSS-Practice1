      <p id="tribute-info">Vincent has only one Limit Break for each of the four levels, and when he initiates one, he turns into an uncontrollable monster and stays that way until the battle is over, or he falls into Death status, which results in him reverting. When he shifts his form, Vincent's stats increase and his HP refills, but he cannot shift back at will.<br><br>

While his Limit Breaks can be powerful, they are risky, as some of the elemental attacks can heal enemies. During his transformation Vincent is immune to Berserk, Frog, and Confusion. Vincent learns his new Limit Breaks the fastest. The offensive properties of Elemental or Added Effect do not carry over to his Limit Break forms, perhaps because he is not using his weapon to attack. Defensive Materia set-ups continue to work. Vincent's Limit Break forms behave oddly under All Lucky 7s since he seems to revert to using his gun though there is no animation for it.</p>
